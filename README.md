# hello-GitHub
This is just my starting in GitHub. Nothing special.
Actually I have been working on programming for 4 years, and until now I'm not a expert on any language. I can use some of them as tools to finish some special task in which I think web application is the biggest. However, many features about certain language like Java are still beyond my cognition. 
When I face to some interesting softwares, I'm fond of thinking how it works and what's structure of the product, so I form some ideas to make something that doesn't exist right now come ture. 
In GitHub, I wish to learn what I didn't know before, do what I want to do, and help who needs help.
